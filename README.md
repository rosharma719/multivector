# multivector

A small, production-shaped late-interaction retrieval engine. Documents and
queries are arrays of token embeddings (for example, ColBERT outputs). Search
uses the PLAID pipeline:

1. A k-means codebook assigns every document token to a coarse centroid.
2. Query-to-centroid interaction probes inverted lists and prunes documents with
   approximate centroid MaxSim scores.
3. Packed 2-bit residuals are fetched from object-shaped storage, decompressed,
   and reranked with the ColBERT MaxSim scoring rule.

This keeps the database API familiar while isolating the expensive multi-vector
work to a small candidate set.

## Run

```bash
cargo run --release -- --dimension 2 --centroids 2 --residual-bits 2 \
  --probes 4 --path ./data --listen 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Train the coarse codebook once before ingestion using a representative sample
of document token embeddings (at least as many samples as centroids):

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/v1/train \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"vectors":[[1,0],[0,1]],"iterations":20}'
```

Ingest already-computed token embeddings:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/v1/vectors/upsert \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"documents":[{"id":"doc-1","vectors":[[1,0],[0,1]],"metadata":{"source":"legal"}}]}'
```

Query with token embeddings from the same model:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/v1/query \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"vectors":[[1,0],[0,1]],"top_k":10,"candidates":80}'
```

The Rust HTTP service intentionally does not embed text: keeping model serving out of
the database lets callers use any late-interaction model and makes offline corpus
and query-log benchmarks reproducible. Candidate generation defaults to
asymmetric MUVERA fixed-dimensional encodings: document buckets store centroids,
query buckets store sums, and empty document buckets use the nearest occupied
SimHash bucket. The centroid path remains available for controlled probe sweeps.
Current FDE search is exact; ANN and product quantization are the next scaling layers.

## Retrieval-quality benchmark

The [free local benchmark](benchmark/README.md) compares this engine with
ColBERTv2 against embedded Qdrant with a MiniLM single-vector model on identical
BEIR documents, queries, and relevance judgments. It reports nDCG@10,
Recall@10, retrieval latency, and index size without using paid APIs.
